# Master-Thesis-Code

Distinguish between Bike and E-Bike using Classification and Object Detection Capabilities

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each code has two versions with and without augmentation.
The dataset included in a folder with all suitable formates for training YOLOv4 types.
The code is quite long you can download or view in colab mode otherwise try to refersh the page couple of time to view the code in github.
The links are included in a folder called links.
In order to run the code on your machine just run each cell with following the comments and locate the directory to the zip file of the dataset.
